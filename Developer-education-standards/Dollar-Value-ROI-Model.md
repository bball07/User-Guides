# Dollar-Value ROI Model: Translating Improvements Into Money

**Purpose**  
This model translates documentation and developer education improvements into **measurable financial impact**. It is designed for consulting engagements, executive readouts, and prioritization decisions where documentation investment must be justified in dollars.

---

## How to Use This Model
1. Collect baseline metrics during discovery.
2. Apply conservative improvement estimates.
3. Use the formulas below to calculate annual impact.
4. Roll results into an executive-facing ROI summary.

---

## 1. Support Ticket Reduction

**Business Outcome:** Lower support and engineering costs

### Baseline Inputs
- Average monthly support tickets (**T**)
- Percentage of documentation-related tickets (**D%**)
- Average cost per ticket (**C**)
- Expected reduction after documentation improvements (**R%**, typically 20–40%)

### Annual Savings Formula
```text
Annual Savings =
(T × D% × C × R%) × 12

1,200 × 0.35 × $45 × 0.30 × 12 = $68,040 
```

### High-ROI Improvements
- Clear step-by-step flows
- Expected outcomes and error explanations
- One-pager troubleshooting guides
- Search-optimized FAQs
---
## 2. Developer Onboarding Time Reduction

**Business Outcome:** Faster time-to-productivity

### Baseline Inputs
- Average onboarding time in weeks (**W**)
- Fully loaded weekly cost per developer (**S%**)
- Number of developers onboarded per year (**N**)
- Expected onboarding reduction (**R%**, typically 20–50%)
### Annual Savings Formula
```
Annual Savings = (W × S × N × R%)
```
### Example Calculation
- 6-week onboarding
- $2,500/week per developer
- 20 developers per year
- 40% reduction
### Annual Savings:
```
6 × $2,500 × 20 × 0.40 = $120,000
```
### High-ROI Improvements
- Clear prerequisites and entry paths
- First-success walkthroughs
- Progressive depth documentation
- Environment setup and validation steps

## 3. Product Adoption and Retention Lift

**Business Outcome:** Increased revenue and usage

### Baseline Inputs
- Monthly active developers or users (**M**)
- Average revenue per active developer or account (**AR**)
- Expected adoption or activation lift (L%, typically 5–15%)

### Annual Revenue Lift Formula
```
Annual Revenue Lift = (M × AR × L%) × 12
```

### Example Calculation
- 3,000 monthly active developers
- $25 average monthly revenue per developer
- 8% adoption lift

#### Annual Revenue Lift:
```
3,000 × $25 × 0.08 × 12 = $72,000
```
### High-ROI Improvements
- Workflow-based examples
- Experimentation steps
- “What to try next” guidance
- Advanced use-case documentation

## ROI Roll-Up Summary
| Impact Area             | Conservative Annual Range |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Support Cost Reduction  | $60k–$150k                |
| Faster Onboarding       | $100k–$300k               |
| Adoption & Retention    | $50k–$200k                |
| **Total Estimated ROI** | **$210k–$650k+**          |
---
### Notes on Assumptions
- Estimates are intentionally conservative
- ROI compounds as documentation becomes first-line support
- Strong documentation reduces long-term headcount pressure
---
### Recommended Pairing
This model is most effective when used with:

- Developer Education & Documentation Quality Scorecard
- Support ticket analysis
- Onboarding funnel review
---
### Status
- Version: 1.0
- Intended Use: Internal consulting, audits, and executive reporting
