# MCP (Model Context Protocol) User Guide

## What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an emerging **open standard** created by **Anthropic** that allows AI models to **communicate with external tools, APIs, and data sources** safely and efficiently.  

Think of it as a **translator between large language models (LLMs)** and the digital world, it standardizes how models fetch and send information.

MCP enables developers to build systems where AI can:
- Query databases  
- Summarize documents  
- Execute code securely  
All **without direct access** to private or sensitive data.

## How Does MCP Work?

MCP defines a **protocol** between a model and a **tool server**.  
The model sends a structured request (for example: “fetch weather data for New York”), and the server responds with standardized data.

This ensures:
- Strict **permissions** for every model action  
- Consistent **data formats** across tools and frameworks  

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "query",
  "tool": "weather_api",
  "parameters": { "city": "New York" }
}
```
Here, the model requests weather data using a ``query`` command.
The **tool server** (in this case, ``weather_api``) processes it and returns a standardized response.

## Why Is MCP Important?

| Benefit              | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standardization**  | One common way for models to communicate with APIs            |
| **Security**         | Prevents direct access to systems, files, or private data     |
| **Interoperability** | Works across multiple LLMs and frameworks (e.g., Claude, GPT) |
| **Extensibility**    | Developers can easily add new tools or integrations           |

## Real-World Use Cases

Developers are already leveraging MCP to connect AI models with:

**Databases** — PostgreSQL, MongoDB

**Internal documentation systems**

**Project management tools** — Jira, Notion

**Custom APIs** — for automating workflows and business operations

**To sum it up:**

MCP creates a unified, secure bridge between AI models and real-world systems,  enabling powerful, controlled integrations without sacrificing safety or structure.
